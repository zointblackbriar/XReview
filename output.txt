El otro tel\u00e9fono vino sin la tarjeta de memoria y los teclados y cargadores son muy distintos.Mi T\u00eda y yo nos sentimos enga\u00f1adas y defraudadas :(","3":"GRACIAS ME LLEGO EL PROCTO QUE COMPRE Y LLEVO EN EL MOMENTO INDICADO Y EN UN BUEN ENVALAJE LO RECOMIENDO SASTIFACTORIAMENTE..","4":"The keys are a little hard to hit, and I didn't expect a Spanish keyboard. But overall, a very good phone.","5":"I bought this phone as a Christmas present for myself because I wanted something a bit more advanced than the Nokia C2 I purchased from Amazon in 2012, but didn't want to go all the way with a smartphone. In other words, a good feature phone with smartphone features without the touch screen. Red, however, is my favorite color, but I went for the white one because my C2 is silver and I couldn't find a silver Asha 302 on Amazon. I've had it for a week and it works great. Best is the Wi-Fi feature, which gives you access to the Web without purchasing a data plan (which I may have to do if I want to access personal email or go on Facebook). It has the great calendar, alarm clock, text messaging, camera, missed\/received call and other features of the C2, which makes it a keeper. And it's a little bigger, with a wider screen, but not so big it can't fit into my pocket or purse. I can use the same Nokia charger I had for the C2. Now all I have to do is await the arrival of my purple phone skin, then I'll be all right. I've had Nokia phones since 1999 and they've never let me down - just get better!","6":"The Phone is pretty good. I am using it with a LycaMobile plan. Only thing that is awkward is that the bottom row of letters is off compared to other phones and devices. Before this I had been using a blackberry. When trying to type on the nokia I am always mistyping Ms, Ns and espectially the shift key (which you need to hit to insert any punctuation)","7":"This phone in an excellent phone at a great price. I was impressed with the features of this phone and would recommend this to anyone.","8":"This is a good phone although it seems to have a small screen. However, it's capable of performing all the basic functions such as calling, messaging, web browsing, social networking and it also has a wi-fi capability.","9":"I've been a long time user of the iPhone. I finally got sick of it and sold it. I just wanted a simple phone. After going through about 3 of them, this fits the bill very well. The texting interface is very nice and intuitive. The battery life is stellar. It connects to the internet just fine. I can check my email in case of emergency, look up directions, etc. Basically everything I was able to do with my smartphone, without the bells and whistles. Having a physical keyboard is quite nice too. The OS seems very stable and snappy. You have things like calendar, todo, memos, etc.Backup is a snap. Just insert an SD card and go to Settings to back it up. No more iTunes! If you want to add music or podcasts, just plug it into the computer, copy paste to the SD card and you're done.I would buy this phone again definitely if I broke or lost it.","10":"This phone, like all of Nokia's feature phones, are great for their value and durability. The last phone I had before buying this one was a Nokia C-3, which was also a great phone. It lasted for years, and probably would have kept going if I hadn't accidentally jumped into a pool with it in my pocket :P This phone is basically an update of the C-3. It is sleek and small, has a full QWERTY keyboard, and has Wi-Fi internet browsing. This is the best phone you can get if you're looking for functionality, but don't want to throw hundreds of dollars at a smartphone with a data plan.And the buyer should be aware; this is NOT a smartphone. If you're looking for anything like a smartphone, you will be disappointed. If you're looking for a toy you can take out of your pocket every couple of minutes to tinker around with, you will be disappointed. Yes, it does have an internet browser which works well, but the screen is quite small so it's not good for recreational browsing. I just use it to look things up, it works fine for that. It also has some social network apps, but I don't use them. I don't know how well they work, but if that's a priority for you this phone probably isn't the best choice. Same goes for the camera; I don't use it, can't speak to its quality, but if a camera is important to you this isn't the best choice.The only other potential negative I can see in this phone is that the keys really are pretty small. I haven't had an issue with them personally, but if someone has big hands I see how this could be annoying.I bought this phone for the advantages to NOT owning a smartphone: longer battery life, higher durability, lower cost, but still good at accomplishing what it needs to. If you're looking for the same thing, Nokia is definitely the best way to go.","11":"Very nice.arrived on time. I love it.","12":"I sent the phone to Colombia, and They had to change the battery because the one the phone came with, did not work. They had to pay almost $50 to replace it.The phone is working as expected after that.","13":"Didn't have the color that originally wanted when the product shipped out. The white one seem to have ran out of stock just as I ordered it a week ago. Got a knock off version instead. I was expecting the original Lenovo phone however, as a gift to my baby sister she enjoyed the cute features.","14":"sometimes the screen and home button are unresponsive to the touch, maybe i got the defective one, but i do like lenovo brand.","15":"Nice phone. Android gsm with 2sims great.","16":"I like this smartphone, good quality very very smartphone, the color, pretty, 5.5 inch perfect in the hand, I recomend this smartphone very very smart. Thank a Amazon and the other seller of china.","17":"I have not reached the tlf","18":"I recevied the phone with broken trackball, missing micro-sd and missing battery.The seller claimed that it is 100% working. i cannot see how such a phone can be workingwithout the internal sd and battery. It claimed that it is OEM and brand new.My obervations indicated this was a poorly attempted refurbished phone. They must berunnin out of second handed parts.","19":"I had high hopes for this Acer phone based their reputation for laptops etc. It is a very well designed phone and it's well made but badly let down by two things.The Android operating is stuck at 4.4 with no hope of an update. The front (selfie) c\u00e2mera which is supposed to be 5 MP is actually about a tenth of that (maybe .5) and very grainy. I checked twice to see if there was perhaps a plastic protective sheet covering the lens, but nothing.Asides from that, the phone works well and has clear calls, a nice screen and fast internet.The battery life is not enough, but all smartphones are the same in that area. I have become accustomed to carrying around a battery pack.All in all, a nice phone let down by the totally unacceptable front camera and out-of-date operating system. Its going back!","20":"It's good","21":"stop working after 5 months, garbage!","22":"I am never one to write negative reviews but if I could give this piece of garbage a negative star rating I would. Please do not trust any of these reviews people. This garbage phone cant even handle the snapchat app. It repeatedly crashed and restarted because it couldn't even process a snapchat video and the audio from any video recording is laughably bad. Returned this and got a refurbished G3 for cheaper which blows this phone AWAY IN EVERY POSSIBLE CATEGORY AND FUNCTIONALITY. STAY AWAY FROM THIS GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!","23":"Excellent product. I recommend very happy.","24":"The phone that I got doesnt work!","25":"Received a great looking and working used phone. No scratches. Check the specific sellers reviews first.","26":"Received a great looking and working used phone. No scratches.

For 195 what I paid I got a hell of a deal no scrapes no major scratches only con was the charger didn't work however I went to the dollar store and purchased a new one. Very good deal for the price don't pass if your looking to buy.","37":"Such a Bummer. The phone was marketed as Un-Locked. It an ATT box that said NEW- complete with Apple-Ear-buds etc.Had already decided to free myself from T-MOBILE- Went to Cricket. Store manager & his asst. tried to get this I-PHONE to work- multiple Micro SIm cards etc. Result- store owner said something is WRONG with the phone. So I figure on a total of Six hours Wasted. I Guess- U Get What U Pay For. I really wanted an I-Phone- but no way can I afford the New Model.","38":"Still using it","39":"its a use cellphone. thats not a brand new","40":"The phone was in excellent condition just as stated..works wonderful..I'd recommend the iPhone 4 to anyway, it's great, love all I can do","41":"hello good morning, this is to place you iphone sim card? for use in Venezuela thank you waiting for your reply","42":"My son purchased this phone. we verified that it was not stolen.. however after it arrived and we went to Verizon to turn it on and it was reported stolen.. we received a full refund, but what a hassle","43":"So far one of the phones has been working good, the other one seems to be havingproblems with the wireless adapter since while downloading some apps it got really slow so I turned the wireless adapter off in order to reboot it and it never came back on again... I'm actually trying to figure out how to return it. None of the phones came with the puncher to be able to insert the SIM card, no manuals and no headphones","44":"battery failure , which did not even last an hour.I want a compensation for the expense that I have to make now for the replacement of the battery.","45":"Battery was BS","46":"the phone did not work, I took it to the apple store and it could not be repaired. I ended up trading it in on another 4s that did work .The phone would not pick up my wi fi or any wi fi. It still cost me another $199.00 but it made my little girl happy. It cost me $102.00 for your phone and 199.00 for the new one. No more refurbished for me.","47":"It looks good and works","48":"Excellent","49":"5 stars!! Love it","50":"The phone I received was exactly what was stated in the description. No defects, scratches or other. The items was quickly paired with the carrier (verizon) and activated. We were able to port the phone number from a different carrier onto the phone without issue. All functions work like it was brand new out of the box. Excellent purchase.","51":"Y try to activate the phone but the Power button some times does`t work Y try to take to the apple store but they said the phone does`t have garanty","52":"This refurbished iPhone 5 works just fine, but the refurbishment was clearly done using a cheaper than OEM replacement screen. We have three phones in the house and although this one works just fine the screen is a little duller in color than the other two.I've replaced screens before and you can buy high and low quality screens. Probably come off the same line, but some don't pass the full quality tests. This refurb phone has a slightly yellowish tint to the screen compared to the other phones. It works just fine so still gets 4 stars, and the price was good, but the slight dimming of the screen drops a star.In the end it still beats paying over $500 for a new phone!","53":"After 2 months of working just fine, the phone suddenly has crapped out. It will not turn on. I'm extremely disappointed and i will never purchase a refurbished phone from Amazon again.","54":"THE PHONE IS GREAT LOVE IT","55":"Ok condition","56":"Thank you so much . I love my phone it came faster than I expected . Worth every penny.","57":"Love it","58":"The phone was returned because it was defective.","59":"Very good, authentic unopened iPhone 5c","60":"You can barely hear out of the speaker","61":"everything it said it was. works great. delivery was faster than expected.","62":"Came straight to my house Give it 5 STARS!!!!","63":"Got this for a great price and it was here fast! Love this phone so much over my old 4S!","64":"great replacement phone for my daughter. put in old sim card and it fired right up","65":"wouldn't turn on","66":"No space","67":"Great","68":"Absolutely Awful This seller sold me a lost or stolen phone that has a block on it. The phone appearance was great however I could not get it activated because there was a system block on the phone.beyond angry! 0stars!!!","69":"Customer loved the replacement phone","70":"This cell phone had a total system failure after only 9 months. The cost to have it repaired is almost equal to the purchase price. But after taking the Iphone to the local Apple store who tried to identify the problem, we learned there is not an option for Apple to repair the phone. It turns out the phone was previously damaged & repaired by a non-Apple repair center using non-Apple approved parts. So we quickly learned all Apple warranties are voided & they will not even attempt to repair the modified phone for any price.","71":"Great phone works well with T-Mobile. Game new out-of-the-box in perfect mint condition. It's the right size phone for me I had a Samsung galaxy S3 before that wouldn't fit in my pocket. This phone is lightning fastsyncs with my iTunes automatically can't say enough good things about it. Seller shipped fast no issues","72":"This iphone came pretty much brand new everything about it was new there were very small nicks in the sides but not even noticeable very nice phone","73":"Terrible. Phone took first charge to 100%. At 30% it went to 0 and turned off. Next charge to %100, then dead after 2 hours. It then wouldn't even take a charge. Garbage","74":"The iPhone 5s is in a very good condition. I started use it immediately when I got it. It's a locked model, only AT&T sim card available.","75":"I give this product 1 star.Description stated 1 hairline crack. The phone arrived and I noticed 3 cracks as well as the sides chipped in two locations. Notice the bottom left corner and middle right. Three cracks can be seen on inspection.Touch ID on the iPhone did not work and continues to not work.Product sold does not match description and would highly recommend users finding another source","76":"The phone constantly cuts of by its self","77":"Great buy. Seller shipped it to me very quickly and it was in great condition. Exactly as posted.","78":"be careful. these phones are still in contract for someone and you can unlock as you are paying the full price","79":"I HATE THIS PHONE, much too small for me and does things I don't like it doing. I miss my Samsung Galaxy S5","80":"Very nice","81":"I bought this phone thinking it was 100% fully functional as stated but the first week I got it I noticed the camera was broken. Within a few weeks the phone started doing things on it's own and acting out. Apps wouldn't work. More problems started occurring. I contacted the seller kindly and didn't even get a response. Very unprofessional. Will not buy from here again.","82":"Great phone and very satisfied.","83":"Great phone, good seller.","84":"PLEASE BE CAREFUL BUYING THIS PHONE. I read a lot of reviews saying that the phone worked and a few saying it didn't...I bought it, the box came with a Sprint sticker on it, but it is not a Sprint phone. I brought it to my Sprint store to have it activated, and was told by 3 different people that it is not Sprint compatible. I'm very disappointed. I would recommend getting this phone elsewhere, if you can.","85":"It came locked and i cant get in it and it still set ass there phone and i need all information so i can get in to it","86":"Product is great and meet my expatations of a telephone what is needed to experience the modern world. Maybe wen ordered from Europe the adapter can be fit to match the european electricity outlets.Regards Peter","87":"I had the iPhone 4S before and was waiting to upgrade to a newer version but didn't really see the need with the iPhone 5, I'm so glad I waited because I'm in love with my new phone. It came just as it was described and the seller communicated with me in reguards to any questions I had, I would deffenately buy from this seller again in the future.","88":"It is good","89":"This phone is okay. My son purchased it, he didn't realize how little storage there is. He is constantly deleting nearly all apps and photos to make the phone operable.","90":"Great phone no problems.","91":"The phone from keeran come as described but was locked. He was able to take it off though. If the apple id is locked u can't register it..","92":"Great all around.","93":"Just got my iPhone in the mail thisy 3rd day using it and everything I just like a brand new iPhone 5s no regrets here for the price I got it...... so far.","94":"It Worked fine for like two weeks and then it stopped working I had to go to the Apple Store to get a replacement because lucky it had warranty","95":"grate phone fore the price. got it for gift for crismas.son loves it.","96":"Not new looking.

I have not received any complaints so that is a plus.","99":"Excellent","100":"Everything with the phone seems good except the work instructions in the package.

The best Smartphone EVER!","104":"Excellent Phone And Excellent Customer Service From Ragstorichs","105":"It's very good, it's new","106":"As advertized, I am super happy. I live outside the USA and it is working 100%","107":"is good iphonees muy bueno y 100 por siento real!","108":"Love it look new","109":"this phone is not unlocked. I bought it to be used in Africa but if it does not work with my T Mobile sim here, I wonder what I will be doing with it in Sierra Leone. I took it to a mobile store today and I was told it is locked to what ever the carier is. I don't have time to return it because I am leaving tomorrow so I had to pay 100 US dollars to get it unlocked. Disappointed","110":"Good","111":"Went great","112":"Fake. Chinese knockoff. Not a real IPhone","113":"like brand new . Thanks vius","114":"That's all I came Phone iphone 6s 64GB. A box is not original. Charger unoriginal and tradition. He did not come with him hands free","115":"There was a chunk missing from the screen...","116":"The package was not originally from apple. It didn't contain the items I was accustomed with my other iPhone.","117":"Phone works well, just as expected. No issues with quality, and delivery was as requested which was important. Not sure if this is the same for all iPhone 6s Plus models, but it seems that the shutter noise on the camera cannot be silenced.","118":"I was hesitant to purchase a refurb'd iPhone, but i must say, the unit arrived flawless. Aside from a paper sticker on the back (easily removed) and the less then stellar packaging, it was indiscernible from a new phone. I charged it fully and after a day of use the battery was still at 90% - granted I don't spend all day on calls, but am I heavy data user. So the battery is as new as well. Note that the charger and cable were included, but no earphones. But I don't care much, as I wouldn't want earphones that have been in a strangers ears. All in all, VERY pleased. Buy SPRY was the reseller mine came from.","119":"Amazon VERIFIED purchase.I upgraded from the iPhone 6 to the iPhone 6S Plus, a big change from size that i would never regret. Plus the extra futures: Faster touch id, live photo and 3D touch. This phone will not bend or crack so easy as the iPhone 6\/6+.I got tthe SIM-FREE with Band 30, and i'm using outside the U.S without any problem. A1634 model.Purchased the model: iPhone 6S Plus 64GB Gold SIM-FREE from Epsilion INC.I was a little bit scared about purchasing with sellers and not with Amazon LLC, but this seller was the best ever.","120":"Best iPhone ever, hands down!","121":"Just as I expected, all info transferred automatically. This company charged me too much, i found a 256gb for $100.00 less","122":"Excelent","123":"Didn't have trouble with vendor or product.","124":"Excelente servicio","125":"Very good","126":"After a long wait the Iphone 7 is now here. Thanks Samsung for messing up the note 7 launch. I would prefer not suffering third degree burns when simply charging your device. Over 2.5 million devices have been recalled and multiple lawsuits claiming negligence on Samsung\u2019s part has been filed for damages. So it looks like apple has a great opportunity here to win back consumers after the 6S failed to captivate the market place. The Iphone 7 is a stunning phone visually. I picked the jet black version as apple has done a nice job here with color design. Going back the design of the phone as we all know the headphone jack has been removed. I do own the apple earpods which work with this bluetooth like technology or whatever and connecting them has been a breeze and so was wearing them for an extended period of time. But still this integration is not perfect. I spent over 100 dollars on wired beats last year and now they cannot be used easily without spending even more money which I refuse to do. Also I do fear I may lose these earphones as they are quite small and can get lost within a backpack it looks like. I have no ideal how the market will react to this change but we will find out. You definitely can adapt to this major design change if you want to. All your volume buttons and power buttons appear to be in the same spot. The touch ID and home button are on the front at the bottom. Both of your volume and power buttons are on the side. The back is a little different now boasting a 12mp dual camera which does in fact produce some great shots that rival the samsung galaxy s7 and edge.Here are some more details on the specsLTE Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30Non expandable storage 16GB, 64GB, 256GB5.5 Retina HD 1920x1080 displayA10 Processor, IP 67Wide Angle and Telephoto ApertureIf you are wondering about IOS 10 well it comes stock with the Iphone 7 and with good reason. They made a lot of incremental changes that adds up. Emojis and gifs now come stock with the messenger app something facebook messenger had for a bit but it\u2019s great to see apple join the bandwagon, siri can now be used with third party apps like linkedin and yelp, sony lyrics were added to apple music\/itunes even voice mail transcription is available. Like usual gaming performance on IOS 10 is great games from asphalt 8 to modern combat 5 plays very well and man oh man do these versions look better than they do on android even with nouget\u2019s vulkan api. They still don\u2019t look as good as they do here. Overall I think I said a line that describes this phone perfectly. They made a lot of incremental changes that adds up in end. Considering the recent blunders of samsung this phone is definitely something you should consider this holiday season. Thanks very much for reading this review","127":"Need to go to the Apple Store. Technical problems like voice volume of the other person is not audible else it's good","128":"Excellent.....","129":"Very good","130":"This phone works perfectly. I actually bought it for my grandson to watch pbs kids without using our phones.","131":"I wish I can give five stars in the beginning but after few months to use the battery doesn't keep long and the picture color doesn't showing good either. I don't know why that happened. I feel very disappointed.","132":"well, I'm enjoying my cell phone thanks..BlackBerry 8520 Unlocked Phone with 2 MP Camera, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi--International Version with No Warranty (Black)","133":"todo muy bien llego mas rapido a venezuela de lo previsto y todo nuevo y en su caja,los recomiendo ampliamente","134":"Good","135":"Todo ha ido muy bien con mi compra, es tal cual como esta en la publicaci\u00f3n y todo ha ido muy bien, estoy complacida con el tel\u00e9fono!","136":"phone arrive very early and was surprise with a memory card added for free. This is exceptional service and was above expectation.","137":"A special gift for a relative's hard work in school.","138":"product is great, but i order it BLACK and it came BLUE.... =\/ still good though","139":"I recently purchase this Blackbery phone but for some unknown reason it is not allowing ne to send SMS texts. I previously bought the same phone but I don't have this problem. I am not sure if it has to do with some special setting or not.","140":"buy the phone send it to my niece she try to activate it and it was lock and it says that is suppose to be unlock dont understand why","141":"i love this phone i just wish i could connected to my WiFi other than that a very good phone..... i am giving it to uncle in Mexico and buying the Kyocera Rise ..... i give it 5 stars","142":"This item is very good! a crisp new blackberry! one of the best phones ever made! how can someone complain about that! if it is delivered broken i guess. this phone was on time! not a day early or late. and with no damage! very pleased.","143":"VERY GOOD","144":"I love this phone , had a blackberry 9700 before since I got this am still wondering why I ever thought it was better than this","145":"I'm going to start of by saying what's really bad about ordering this phone.1- When I tryed to use the charger for the first time it did not work.2- The phone case that comes with this order looks old and used.3- After using this phone for 3\/4 months it is starting to give troube ( Sticking etc )Good things about this phone1- The phone itself works great.2- It does the jobI'm happy with this phone but it isn't a 5 star","146":"The phone did not come with the Memory Card as the tittle said!! Other than that, the phone is working good.","147":"I bought a white Blackberry 9900, through my skybox, as I live in Trinidad from this company and it was the best! I got ALL of the accessories with the phone. The memory card and the headset. I've bought other blackberry from other companies online and it did not include a memory card or headset, only the phone, battery and the charger. I am thankful and am enjoying my phone very much.","148":"I have nothing against the phone at all. it is generally a decent phone, but because of the seller i am truly disappointed. I bought a new phone only to receive the package and realise id was used, it had no user manual and there was a number attached to the phone and the network sprint. Because of where i live in the caribbean i had to settle for a 10% refund because it will cost me much more to send it back...I am sorry but that is just totally poor, really disgusted by this seller.","149":"YOU SAID THIS IS AN UNLOCKED PHONE BUT IT STILL NEED UNLOCKED CODE!!!!!!!!! PLEASE TELL MEI NEED TO USE CHINESE SIM CARD","150":"Todo bien; el producto completamente nuevo, sin novedad, el telefono lleg\u00f3 sin problemas al sitio, despacho fue r\u00e1pido, los componentes del telefono era todos nuevos","151":"I found very good is 100% recommended hope to buy another look as they are very responsible I would recommend them to other future purchase thanks","152":"My buddy is very thankful and happy for this blackberry, its brand new and comes in its original box, the touch screen is just really great..","153":"great cell phone cool","154":"I wanted to buy a new product, the quality unused blackberry are not new housings also have original factory not, really is not what it says on the details of the product, nor bring the latest version of software I touch update to add Spanish language, at the time I had to send a change a cell housing was loose since. in my country is called scam.","155":"Fue una buena compra pero no saio como yo queria porque yo coloque mala la suite les recomiendo que lenan bien porque les puede pasar como yo !","156":"Greatest phone ever. Wont leave home without it.","157":"good cellphone","158":"Great phone just what I wanted for someone who does not need high powered cellphones with a bigger size.","159":"Love the color","160":"Its a simple duty phone and it has small phone memory it didnt run good until i added 2 gb sd card.. Shipping was fast. Camera isnt clear but its good device for th price","161":"good","162":"Very good budget phone. Works in Venezuela","163":"Overall this phone is ok. It's very cheap, so you get what you paid for.Don't expect this to be just as good as any other smartphone out there. The internal memory is very low, so you really can't download more than 1 or 2 apps, unless you root it. Whatsapp works fine on it which is what I got it for, picture quality is ok as well. Forget about web surfing even if you have a good connection, it's a 30$ phone.","164":"Its OK just wasn't what I expected","165":"than you i like this phone is very beautiful for my little niece","166":"Sent back two small","167":"Good phone","168":"Perfect for my niece. Wouldn't buy for adult use.","169":"Great item","170":"No","171":"So...the major downside is the non removable battery. If the phone overheats or freezes (youd have to do a forced restart) you have to remove the cover and wait up to 20minites before you're able to power it back on. The battery life is laughable, if you don't watch Netflix or play games on your device you can probably get 3days out of a single charge. I don't like the cluttered layout. I'm used to there being a central menu icon for me to open all the apps on my phone. This phone doesn't have that, ALL the app icon are displayed on the front screens, there's no shortcut.Also, it doesnt have the typical layout of the otjer blu phones like if youre in a web browser you cant change tabs, you have to press one of the icons at the bottom of your phone to find ot, its soooo inconvenient and not at all efficient. People have told me it has the look and layout of iPhones-i dont buy Apple and this only reaffirms why I will never consider one. The camera SUCKS unless you're outside. Sound is great, picture quality can be improved. I've had better BLU phones (my fave is still the Studio 5.5s) Its a great phone, phenomenal for the $127 price.","172":"Well I have to say I love my phone. Battery lasts a very long time. Camera works very well and has lots of cool features. I'm on the metro Pcs network and it's running smoothly just like any other high priced phone. Selfies are great thanks to the added flash. Some people complained about the volume but my phone is actually pretty loud. Not a fan of the home display, theirs no app drawer but I fixed that by downloading Nova launcher. Overall a great phone for the price.","173":"Phone works great! Pushing it to its limits. Sucks on Straight Talk.","174":"Blue Life 8XL said to be upgradeable to Android 5.0, it is not. We have had for 3 no and Blue had not made upgrade available. Beware inaccurate advertising.","175":"Bought this for my daughters birthday...and within 6 days it would not turn on, just made a chime noise...tried to reset it and still nothing. I am sending it back for a refund...it is junk. Don't buy it...the reviews on marketplace are bogus...because it is no good.","176":"Consistently freezes, won't acknowledge connection randomly","177":"Very good phone approved 100%","178":"BLU PURE XL Smartphone - 4G LTE GSM Unlocked - 64GB +3GB RAM - GoldI must say I am very satisfied with this product. The battery life is as stated. Pretty much last me the entire day. The screen is clear and bright and highly responsive. Wasn't a big fan of the app drawer not being available but I have gotten so use to not having it, I actually don't miss it. The internal space is much more that I could ask for not to mention the 3gigs of Ram power I have at my disposal. The camera is super clear, may not be the best compared to other but it does put up a challenge, even in low lighting. Also the dedicated shutter button is very convenient where it is placed. I think i will hang on to this phone for a while until BLU plans to make an upgrade to this. One again I am super pleased.","179":"This phone can compete with any top selling Samsung or iPhone! The only problem is the speaker isn't the loudest I've heard, but it is good enough. Here's suggestion erase everything you don't need that was pre-installed on the phone such as, wallpapers, apps and buy a either a 32 or 64gb micro sad card. Recommended SD card is Samsung 32GB EVO Class 10 Micro SDHC up to 48MB\/s-1 (sold on amazon) it can handle HD speeds for video recording.","180":"Hi the phone is nice , but it missing onething the cover where to put the sim card don't have ion it please send me the part cuz the sim can be lose","181":"It works on AT&T 4G and T-mobile 4G US, and is dual-sim. It's a great phone for the money, but with only 1Gb of ram, it is sometimes annoyingly slow to respond, switch between apps, and load webpages. I miss having a hardware key for the camera, but it otherwise works well. Also, the speaker is reasonably loud and sounds good.","182":"I give 5 stars because the performance of this phone is excellent having in consideration the price,LTE,OS lollipop ,fast respons etc.No complaint for battery and camera didn't expected first quality for the price I paid","183":"Purchased this phone for my son for Christmas and he loves it. It was a great pick for him. It does everything he needs and want it to do","184":"Phone works really well. My only real problem with it is that even 200 miles west from the Eastern Timezone, my phone will change to the Eastern time zone. It does it 30 minutes away too. That's using the network provided timezone. Another problem I have encountered is that the phone collects fingerprints very easily. One last complaint is the Pandora App seems to quit a lot, but it looks to be happening with most phones according to the reviews on the Google Play Store, so it isn't something wrong with this phone.Camera works pretty well, I don't really use it too much though. The other great things about this phone was it was only $100 and works brilliantly for the price. The space on the phone can be enlarged with an SD card. Free case seems cheap, but it's expected for something that is free.Highly recommend the Blu Studio C Mini to anyone looking for a smartphone without the expensive $150+ price tag. It looks like this phone will be usable for years to come.","185":"great phone","186":"The phone is OK, there have been some sound issues during calls.","187":"Easy, fast and great for the price","188":"Worst phone ever","189":"the phone came in disrepair, it does not work, I play throw it away, just ways thanks","190":"After putting my Sim card in I no longer have picture messaging","191":"Basic, but do what we need.","192":"A very good cellphone like it was displayed. I love it.","193":"Excellent retail management.","194":"Good product","195":"buena","196":"Great device","197":"Good","198":"excellent product works great","199":"I love this little device it is not obvious and it travels with me everywhere all I have to say after you take the battery out calibrate the pen as the touch screen works better if it is calibrated every time on my unit other then that. this is an awesome device. love it","200":"Good","201":"GOOD","202":"Phone is rugged but reception is sketchy at my house. Had no problems w\/last phone, so it's gotta be this one. Also, audio quality is not good. And finally, it has a lousy owner's manual, written mostly in Chinese. If you read Chinese, all is well. Forget this one, spend a few extra bucks and get a good phone.Post Script: Another problem, I had to refill a prescription and enter my birthdate. For some reason, the keypad continually sent the wrong numbers. Though it was me, but something in the phone would enter a 6 for a 9. Dialing a phone # was no problem. JUNK.","203":"I am very pleased with my little red phone. Service is great and the price is too.","204":"This phone is pretty good. It met my expectations: good screen, good space to install Apps (approximately 4GB), it is fast, good sound and good camera. I do not give 5 starts because, although effectively this phone is unlocked for telephone operators, has a lock to level \"Mobile Hotspot\" because not allowed, to use this function, and according to what you find is, apparently, caused by AT&T.","205":"A great product with a great price! The phone works very well ever since I got it. No battery issue so far as other reviewers have mentioned. Bought another one for my niece and will get one for my husband!","206":"Brought this phone for my dad and he hated it. I even played with it for a day and it sucked. It calls people by itself and text people also. DO NOT BUY.","207":"garbage","208":"The battery for the phone refuse to stay in the slot and for that the phone keep shutting off or heating up. My husband is really unhappy with this purchase I made for him.","209":"This phone is awesome, bottom line. The battery lasts a full day with moderate use, the processor is fast, the camera and camera features are great, and it is a beautiful phone. There are tons of reviews online that go over how great this phone is. My main criticism is the apparent lack of quality control. The first HTC One I received could not take pictures without them being blurry. It turned out to be a hardware issue. There was also static when I plugged int a headset due to a loose connection. I had to return the phone and received a new one. The new one's camera works as it should an the headphones do not have a loose connection or static when listening to music or on a phone call. On my new phone, the volume rocker sticks out slightly. The differences between the two phones I had highlights some quality control issues in the manufacturing process of this phone. Overall I definitely recommend the phone, but beware of the issues I have had.","210":"I own a Galaxy S2 (and iPhone 3GS before that) and was confused which one to buy next. The main candidates were Galaxy S4, HTC One and LG Optimus G Pro. Finally decided with HTC One and have no buyer's remorse! Was very impressed with the quality and performance. The display is excellent and has no purple discoloration seen in Samsung phones (and LG to a lesser extend). For the first time in many years, I can use the a phone without charging every day! The battery is lasting for 2 days easily! The camera is a delight and takes excellent shots with good quality. The HTC Zoe is very nice and built-in Zoe software create 30s clips with random photos and videos and has a professional touch. I normally dont use these kind of mobile photo apps, but was pleasantly surprised with the wonderful quality clips it creates (it has some bugs to fix though) - my daughter never used to pose for photos before - with the Zoe, she always want to take photos and watch the Zoe clip afterwards! I use my phone for office email and calendar, and they are very good and are miles ahead of the ones I had in S2(S2 with Android 4). Not sure if they are part of standard Android 4.1 or special HTC apps - in any case, they are very usable now. The BlinkFeed is good and gives you a news-stream(like Pulse) right on the home screen. And yes, I forgot to mention the front-facing dual speakers. With other phones, once you put a case, the volume used to be very low and suppressed. With the speakers being on the front, I no longer have the problem. In short, I will recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a phone they wont regret buying.Pros:- excellent display (1080p - crystal clear)- excellent battery life (lasts for 2 days)- excellent camera quality- front-facing speakers- improved(and yes, usable) mail\/calendar apps for office use with easy Microsoft Exchange integration- HTC Zoe 30s clips- HTC BlinkCons:- no micro-SD card slot- can not replace battery easily (not removable like Galaxy phones)- some bugs in HTC Zoe software","211":"This phone is GREAT! The M7 is the extremely fast, even playing some of the graphic intensive games. It has 2 gigs of ram which makes multitasking much easier. Loading a custom rom\/kernel on this device will really show it's true potential.Now.. About the seller.. They are selling REFURBISHED phones. The first phone I received was in pristine cosmetic condition. Not a single scratch on the screen, it looked like a new phone from the carrier! Except it wasn't. It was stuck in a bootloop and when it finally started it seemed like the phone would register the power button being held down and would restart every so often. It was having trouble reading the sim card too. I sent it back and got another one with a few minor cosmetic issues but the hardware ran fine. I've had the 2nd one for almost a month and it has given me no problems at all.Since these phones are refurbished, you're going to get those that AT&T customers purchased and sent back. It could have been due to a technical problem or they just didn't want the phone. So keep in mind that it's possible to a phone that might have some kind of hardware issue.Regardless, 5 stars because they refunded me the money no questions asked! The phone is amazing and in my opinion better price wise than the M8 (which is faster but not by much).","212":"Love my phone I have had all the HTC this is the best. Can't wait for the next one.","213":"I LOVE this phone! I've always been a huge fan of HTC phones and this one blew me away! I love the dual speakers and the sounds quality is incredible. The other reason I really wanted it was for the camera. HTC has always had great cameras and this one is by far the best! The battery life is incredible as well. It charges quickly and hold the charge for most of the day. The only thing I do not like is that the body is sealed and i can't remove the battery if need be.","214":"It broke on me...the first 3 weeks.","215":"Excellent !!","216":"I just received my phone and I'm really happy with this. In the past I had a standard HTC m8 but it was too big for my little hands so I decided to wait until mini version arrives to USA . Meanwhile I had an iPhone but even though the elegance of IOS I have always preferred Android and I am here. I have to tell I was sceptical about buying an unlocked phone from Amazon but until now I don't have any complaints about phone, it works perfectly with my at&t carrier service.","217":"Amazing, fast. I am really astonished with the speed, response and design of the device.I'm really convinced of this decive rocks over other \"famous\" devices in market","218":"Excellent!","219":"Excellent Cellphone, does everything they say.","220":"Es un super telefono","221":"lacking the key to put sim . did not come with the original charger","222":"I bought this phone couple weeks ago, thought I was getting a good deal until I took d phone home. This phone was advertised as \"unlocked\" however upon inserting my sim card it prompted me that I had to get d phone unlock. Now I hve to pay extra to unlock dis AT& T branded phone. I would appreciate if d truth be advertise for consumers. I work hard for my money and I was deceived n con by d seller. Like I said planning to take d phone internationally think twice about buying!Signed,Very disgruntled customer!","223":"perfect size and colorbig down side for me is that i live in a smaller town so I dont get service well on a good day i can maybe get one or two bars in my roombut with everything else being how i want who needs toe receive the calls or text lol","224":"I love this phone. It is an awesome smartphone.","225":"This phone is what a smart stands for; the navigation system is right on the directions to the destination .very shape pictures. I like the voice search to any places with an address where to go. Most of all, the tone when speaking or receiving calls is very clear. I love my HTC Smartphone. HTC, HTC 1 or HTC 2 are all quality smartphones. THE BEST EVER !!!!","226":"It was a delightful surprise to find that this phone came complete with all of the accessories in the original packaging!","227":"just started having a few issues but it has worked fine","228":"I bought one of these for my wife when Windows Phone 7 launched, and it is probably her favorite gift from me besides her engagement ring. I just bought a couple more; one is a backup for when hers gives up the ghost eventually, and the other is to replace my Zune HD.Zune Pass has been hard to find players for since Microsoft decided to drop the Zune hardware in favor of software for Windows Phone, Xbox 360 and Windows XP, VIsta and 7 for PCs. My Zune HD has been circling the brink for a while, and in the past couple weeks it's been a sad remnant of it's former self. My wife made the comment that she thought her phones sounded better than my Zune anyways, so I plugged my Klipsch X10 IEMs into her phone.....I have never been more surprised in my entire life. The sound coming out of this phone was indeed better than any portable MP3 player I have ever used. It's got a high quality amplifier too, and I no longer carry a portable amp.If your Zune dead or is about to bite the dust --look no further. At $200 or less this device costs about as much as a Zune HD did, and it sounds significantly better. If you're concerned about 16GB not being enough: my wife put a 64GB Class 4 Micro SDHC in hers, and I plan to do so as well. Keep in mind though, swapping the internal SD card will void the warranty.","229":"All very good, excellent product.","230":"t camera and design*update* still love the phone as much as I did.be sure to get a case it would be a shame to dent\/scratch this beauty.the ppi is definitely noticeable.it's only a 1080p screen but again the pixel density makes up for it.NFc technology is active if your into tech.","231":"Network weak","232":"Great phone good price. It needs to come with instructions in English, not everyone reads Chinese.","233":"excellent service and product as described","234":"Good excelent","235":"very good","236":"Best phone I have had. Fingerprint sensor is exeptional and unlocks the device in blazing speed. The battery life last me almost two days.","237":"It's less than half the price of Galaxy 6, but its features and look and feel are very comparable.","238":"Phone looks and feel nice. It is about the size of an Iphone 6 plus. I was not expecting it to be that large but I still like it. The user interface is a little different than what I previously had but didn't take long to get adjusted to. The phone seems to be pretty fast. The only drawback so far is the lack of finding a case that I like. not much out there to pick from.","239":"Just bought a gx8 from Amazon. After one day of exploring, I realized it does not have wifi calling feature like most android phones do. If you are inside a building or a basement with not cell signal, you are screwed. I am seriously considering returning this phone to Amazon.","240":"Just switched from iphone 6s plus to this product. Just love it! Well, it is not completely as good as the iphone 6s, but it reached 80% performance\/functionalities of it. The exterior is flawless!! But most importantly, it only costs 1\/3 of an iphone. I used to change an iphone in every 3 years. But now with the same cost I can change a Huawei phone every year. I don't have to. But what I am trying to say is that the quality\/price ratio of this product is just excellent!","241":"I bought the phone July 2014,It didn't work well on voice function since March 2015, when there's either incoming or outgoing call,both side cant hear the voice,unless i click on the \"speaker\" to have the speaker on, and its overheating when call is going on, there must be something wrong, other than that,the screen is big which is very good for browsing, but the voice function is not working well now,and that's the main function and purpose for having a phone,.i need to get it fixed or get a new phone,i hope there's factory after-sale service ,so far i don't know how to get this fixed.","242":"This phone ages quickly. My previous phone was a Blackberry and I never had a single problem with that phone in six years. When I first got this Huawei the only problem was that in the middle of a conversation, I could hear the other person but he couldn't hear me. Then it progressed to other issues. Like in the middle of a conversation, Airplane mode would turn on even if I was on speakerphone. Since I didn't know what had happened the other person couldn't call me back and I couldn't call out. So look at your notification area for the little airplane. Also, it automatically stops ringing the phone and callers go immediately to voicemail (their contact is not set to \"all calls to voicemail\", the phone is not in airplane mode when this happens, and the volume setting is not at zero). The wi-fi and bluetooth automatically turn off, screen brightness automatically reduces to zero. These are just a few of the settings which automatically turn on or off or down.I bought this to be a phone and that is the most problematic app of all.I must power off this phone several times a day to get it to work reasonably well.","243":"This has been a good phone for the money. The camera isn't very good to be a 13 meg pixel because it just doesn't take that good a picture.","244":"I like the size of the phone but since it won't work with 4G I get very spotty 2Mbps coverage. It's just too slow to use. It also keeps auto dimming despite setting the brightness to max. This is my second and last Huawei.","245":"i expected a swivel belt clip","246":"Cell good, I loved it and as long as they have been using has not failed me. It is observed that when I put it in Spanish language not completely translated the system. your camera, set it up well despite not making good pictures compared to another cell. you could say that the camera is 10 megapixel although the device say 13 megapixel","247":"Its OK its labeled 4g but only operates on 3g speed. The only hang ups I have is the bloatware and constant updating plus some functions are in Chinese. Other than that it's performance is great. Camera resolution is great","248":"This is my second VN270. My first one was damaged. This was my best choice over updating to a new phone locally. I just needed the basics, liked a keyboard and this phone works great.","249":"My grand daughter really likes her phone and had not had any problems with it","250":"I understand the product was used, but WOW!! The seller failed to mention the battery has a crack in it. Also, the phone was NASTY!! This phone looked horrible!! I ordered this as a Christmas gift for my daughter. I did get it switched over without it being prepaid. Just not happy with the condition of the phone and the dirtiness. There were also saved text messages on the phone, no big deal. But one was about having sex with a llama. Didn't need to read tht. Oh, and the charger is not the right charger.","251":"My husband loves it, will not put it down. The charger doesn't fit into a normal outlet, but a decent phone! The memory is kinda low. And i cant figure out how to make my main saving source the SD card","252":"The phone's internal screen was cracked. They said they would replace it but never did. The is unable to use the inside screen","253":"the article was not as it is described, the screen did not have the logo of LG seemed that would have changed the touch","254":"The specifications on the publication are not correct with the actual technical decription of the item.","255":"The lg phone phone is unlocked and works just fine. TMobil says the phone is stolen, on nov. 30, 2014. Will I be introuble with the LAW?","256":"I hope this helps many people that are still trying to decide if they should buy this cellphone or not. I currently live in the US but I will be using the phone in other countries. Many reviews say that it doesn't work here in the US for mobile data but IT DOES. You maybe won't get 4g LTE but, let's face it, that network is not available everywhere even if you had an American phone. You can have up to 3G and it works perfectly well. I think some of the people giving the reviews (this is just my opinion, maybe it is not true for them) didn't check the APN information when configuring it on the phone and didn't notice that the name of the APN gets automatically picked up wrong by the phone. I have AT&T and in their website they tell you how to configure the APN yourself when you \"bring your own device\" I went ahead and created an APN myself with the information on the website and got my data back. Now, regarding the package being open, mine was but the phone and everything inside was new and had all the plastic covers. It comes with charger, USB cable AND earphones (something that was quite a surprise since the American version doesn't come with that).","257":"Nice phone, but i bought this phone because they said LTE but they sent me just a 3G phone. Very disappointed.","258":"Stopped working after 3 months....","259":"loving it so far. amazing picture quality","260":"I really love the phone. The camera is much improved. I was confused by the black phone and white charging equipment. The Amazon rep told me that's standard.","261":"This is a great phone. I really like the way it feels, looks, and how intuitively easy it is to program as well as use. It's simple to make all kinds of major changes in the way it looks and operates. The only down side is the battery. It runs down very quickly. That said, I'm still thrilled with and will recommend it to others.","262":"Very good, no have problem.","263":"Nice n working well!! Have some battery problem though...","264":"This was an international version of Nexus 5. It is not compatible with US 4G LTE","265":"One of the best budget phones with pure android. Although, it has some bugs sometimes, and build quality is.. meeh, but, for this price...","266":"GOOD","267":"I bought this phone gift for my Brother so i took with me to Turkey,But as soon he start to use this phone, on half day Battery died sometime he has to charge the battery 2 or 3 time a day,,so we find up battery is no good,so we have to buy new Battery,and he get second problem every call he get he can't hear any one,he decide not use this phone anymore,just waste of money","268":"best phone ever this thing is a bullet proof phone it terms of rooting and software tweaking experience","269":"My mom loved it.","270":"Awesome phone, lots of storage, great features, beautiful screen. I'm happy with it!","271":"I was skeptical of buying this item because of a bad review, but this company and the item has exceeded my expectations. The company was quick to process the order and the product was at my house within 3 days (standard shipping). From the description it sounded as if this would be a hard plastic case (which I wanted) and from one review, it sounded like it would be silicone (which I did not want), but I was pleased when it arrived and it was hard rubber - a happy medium. The \"white\" of the case is kind of see through, but it really looks nice. After a week a small piece of the design flaked off by the seam, but it is hardly noticeable. With some abuse, I can see this design not exceeding a life span over a year, but the case will always be fine. I received a few unsolicited compliments about how pretty the phone case was already and for the price, I am thinking of buying a couple more from the company to change out with my mood.","272":"Great rubberized case! Instead of being flimsy silicone, it has a nice firm rubber feel to it. It's a snap on, fits snug and perfectly and has a cool look to it. Looks nicer than silicone cases AND nicer than the hard plastic snap cases that look shiny and cheap. The screen protector is okay, but it attracted too much lint in the air and I couldn't get the bubbles out so I'll have to order another. Perhaps it would have worked with a more careful application.","273":"Thank you","274":"I purshes this ad on for my cell phone sprit smatphone with android,perfect fit clip on solid hard to revove,no slip off.The delivery wos ontime,on problem,great service,great job, Thank you.","275":"They sent me the wrong case. I was so disappointed with this in so many ways! I was supposed to receive a nightmare before christmas case and got this flower one! They did however let me return the case which I did get my money back, but I would have rather gotten the case I wanted!","276":"This case is for an LG Optimus S but fits the LG Optimus V Perfectly!! Since putting the case on my phone i dropped it once and the case never came off! I realy liked the design of the case and it looks better in person! I recommend this seller to anyone. My items arrived on time and securely packaged. THANKS!","277":"it seas extremely hard to get my music on it and u can't great playlists and the phone randomly restarts it self like more than 10 times a day and feezes a lot I don't like it I would rather have an android phone","278":"Purchased the phone, received in timely manner....but when i got it, the time battery will not stay charged, it will not play the mini sd card and a screw is missing from the screen:( not happy..","279":"This phone is easy to maneuver and user friendly. I originally bought this phone for my mother who I had to pry away from her OLD samsung flip phone that had NO camera NOT EVEN A SPEAKER PHONE OPTION! She was able to adapt almost immediately and made the phone look so fashionable that I bought this blue one for myself! The colors are a definite added bonus...","280":"I bought this phone for my son, who has had lots of 'updated' phones in his life. He LOVES the feel of the slider keyboard. It's almost like it fits his fingers better. The keys are slightly raised so that you can hit the proper keys with better accuracy. The only problems with this phone are: he wasn't able to receive picture texts (it may just have had to be tweaked), the battery will drain while searching for service in areas where signals are weak, so he has to make sure to turn it off in those areas. (Other phones didn't do this) Other than that, the touch screen is nice, camera takes great pics, and the other features are great as well. All in all a great phone.","281":"Great phone for the money. Easy to operate and also a nice looking phone in a sapphire blue. I would definitely recommend this phone.","282":"This phone work amazingly.","283":"The most important for me is that it let me work smoothly in my Windows ecosystem: laptop, tablet phone, xbox.","284":"Not too bad.","285":"As a Tmobile customer, I was saddened when I learned they will not carry Windows Phone anymore. Ive had the Lumia 635 for quite some time but I knew it was time for a new phone when any charging chord wouldn't latch into the phone without wiggling it around. Then news dropped of the Lumia 950 came around and I researched it and was pleased with most of the reviews. Contrary to some of the gripes some people had with the phone, Visual Voicemail works just fine with Tmobile customers. Setting up the phone was effortless. Also opening the plastic cover is easy. My only complaint is, in fact, the plastic cover. Wear and tear on my previous Lumia resulted in the plastic back cover cracking on the edges even with having a shockproof phone case on the phone at all times. Plus, the plastic cover makes the phone slick and actually slipped out of my hands twice in the first 24 hrs. With that said, I highly suggest purchasing an easy to grip, shockproof case for this phone.Other than that, I highly recommend this phone. Especially if you are a fan of the Windows phones. And Double especially (new phrase, I just created, don't judge me) if you're tired of the Galaxy\/Iphones. Great UI (as always), beautiful and FASTEST camera I've ever seen on a phone, and recharging the phone is incredibly fast. Just this morning, it went from 20% to full charge in 75 minutes!!! I can definitely see myself with this phone for the next couple of years, or at until the Surface Phones finally launch. ;-)","286":"I can't even tell you how much I love this phone. It is the best phone I've ever had. Spectacular camera! I have t-mobile. I put in my sim card and had 0 issues getting it to work. Wi-Fi calling even worked, which a lot of people online said it wouldn't.You must love windows phones to want this phone. I've used them for several years and love it for business.Check out a couple accessories for the phone from Microsoft as well. I got the display dock for free while Microsoft was running a promotion. It's a cool little device that turns your phone into a laptop using any HDMI TV.Look at the features of the phone, it's a great phone. Awesome display, huge. Really good for watching netflix\/hulu.Awesome, awesome phone.","287":"So,the phone arrived with no phone case and no earphones either. I don't know if this is how new phones are packaged or they are just missing.Please advise accordinglyThanks","288":"Windows 10 mobile has caught up with the competition. Best phone the market, very user friendly. Just needs more app support by developers, other than that flawless!","289":"This is the single SIM card version, not the duel SIM available on Microsoft.com. However it does have all other features of the Lumia 950 XL. It did come with a Chinese wall plug but also included a US to China wall adaptor in the box from the seller. It also came with a USB A to USB C cable that can charge the phone from any computer or USB charger.It did not come with the Lumia Offers app pre installed to get the free docking station offer (offer only valid until Jan 31st 2016) however the app can be downloaded by visiting the Microsoft store web page, not the built in app store. And searching for the Lumia Offers app (note: You must have the edge browser set to mobile web pages , not desktop pages for the download button to work). Once the app is downloaded you can register for the code to use at check out to make the docking station free on the Microsoft store.","290":"so far the phone is working good and was easy to set up with consumer cellular","291":"This phone is light years from my old Samsung. Very fast & responsive. I like the finger print unlock. Screen quality is very good. It syncs up to my other devises on its own.","292":"UPDATE July 25 2016: Verizon finally sent me the correct Sim card. It may not be available yet from Verizon Flagship stores. The SKU # you will need to request the Moto G4 Sim card from Verizon Customer Service is: DFILLSIM3FF-D. Just setting up the phone so can't review the phone yet.Rather than rating the product which I have not been able to use, I found out the hard way that this phone is not compatible with a NEW Verizon Sim Card. Those lucky enough to have a \"current\" smartphone with Verizon that has a compatible Sim Card can just switch it over to the Moto 4G.. However my Droid Charge does not have a compatible Sim Card (too large) so I am supposed to get a free Sim from Verizon. Problem is that the new Sim card does not recognize the Moto G4 and, therefore, will not be given to me. According to Verizon flagship stores, Verizon does not have Motorola Moto G4 unlocked phone on it's list approved locked phones, so sounds like Motorola and Verizon have not reached an agreement. Some people have used a \"work-around\" by having a Verizon Flagship store activate a new Sim Card by using a Verizon phone \"Test Device\" to activate the Sim Card using your current smartphone number and then putting the active Sim Card in the Moto G4. I have been to 3 Flagship Verizon stores in the D.C. metro area and none of them were willing to use the \"work-around\" claiming it is not legal and they do not have test phones to be used for this purpose. Spent too many hours talking to Verizon and Motorola Customer Service but there doesn't seem to be a solution so I may have to return the phone. Others in my situation basically gave up because of the frustration. Motorola has a forum on their website on this issue and there is no resolution or reference to solving this problem with Verizon. Will update if Verizon or Motorola find a solution.","293":"I don't receive my memory card.I guess they took it out. the phone was good for 1year,but after that I see some call drops,shut off by itself.Overall , it is not bad for the price.","294":"Great phone for this price","295":"The phone in good conditions. But every day he says without a sim and I put another sim and says the sameI would like a part of the refund to have to accommodate the softwareI was a technician and he said that I was the reader yes, I think it's a fraud I want a refund, please, the piece comes to me at $ 20","296":"I had what i expected from vendor. Good service. I got it on time. I just have to use it and enjoy my device.","297":"First of all, the phone is well built, and very response with Windows phone 8 OS. Also... It has the best camera in the market. I was amazed with it.However, the the battery is horrible... It dies fast. Also, the cellphone's GPS is by far the worst of all platforms. It takes a while to set directions to a place to another. And On walking mode, all the time it request to calibrate the GPS, making you to move the lumia in the 8 sign. While I was walking, I stopped several time to re-calibrate again.Actually, I returned the Lumia 1020 because it came defective, the infamous light bleeding display...But I tell you this, I totally recommend the 1020, if you want to take pictures! Its badass! I love camera, but I love performance... I got the S5 instead...I hope with windows phone 8.1, the Lumia 1020 may have performance improved...","298":"Very Good.......Excellent","299":"I bought this Nokia Lumia 800, it was working ok. But one day it did not turned on any more. Only 2 months of use and it stopped working. And the worst part is that the HASSLEFREECELL sold me this cellphone with an Europe warranty, I can not fix it in US.","300":"They never reached the headphones and the battery is not original, part of the rear camera arrived detached , do not recommend them .","301":"The main reason I got this phone because of \"NOKIA SUITE\" I CAN CONNECT TO INTERNET ANY WHERE WITH MY LAPTOP OR COMPUTER AND GO ONLINE WITH IT.AND EVEN RECEIVE TEXT WHILE ON MY LAPTOP OR COMPUTER VERY HAPPY WITH THE SELLER ALSO EXCELLENT SERVICE","302":"Love it.","303":"Great quality and it came as pictured. It does exactly what I need it to do. I love otterbox!","304":"Works great with my phone and protects it well","305":"This is a phenomenal idea. I actually keep three cards in mine, and I hope to never go back to digging through my pockets for my credit card or carrying a wallet. The only problem is that I'm on my fourth case in probably a little over a year. The tiny plastic hinges that hold the door on tend to break if the phone is dropped, even lightly. Otherwise, great product.","306":"great product, I will do business with them again","307":"we were very surprized that we recieved the same case,only a diiferent color, that we recently purchased for $60.. and this was a total of $17??? ya thats why we r back on amazon right now.. great case great fit and great price..","308":"I purchased this thinking it would fit the IPOD touch 5. It is loose and doesn't fit well","309":"I ordered the purple and pink case and I absolutely love it! It fits perfectly and the colors are so much better in person! I ordered it Tuesday June 28th and got it July 1st. I have never had anything ship to me so fast across the country and in amazing condition! I love my case and definitely recommend it!","310":"bought this phone to replace a Samsung galaxy proclaim. It has a great huge display and it carries well in your pocket feels like a small wallet. The only let down is the internal memory but that is fixed with a bigger sd card. This is a great phone and a great price. If you are looking for a good entr\u00e9e level phone you wont be disappointed..i love it","311":"So far so good. . .no issues....works great....","312":"If you want or need small...this is it! Just like its grown ups, it is a full functional phone. The only real draw back to it it the inability to use the stock keyboard for any practical purposes, but after install a \"big button keyboard\" app and turning the phone sideways, that is even manageable.","313":"Freezing every day. disappointed but it is a good phone with nice screen and camera but freezing is bother you everyday","314":"Item as described","315":"The phone looks great, it's working fine. So far very good.","316":"This is just a great phone! I needed something that was a reasonable size - hopefully the bigger-is-better craze goes away soon. This was one of just two phones small enough (and it's still pretty large, around the size of an iPhone 5).The screen looks great, overall it performs quickly, though the camera does seem to be sluggish. Once it's taken a photo, though, the picture quality is excellent.","317":"This device doesn't working in hot climates.I am very disappointed, in the winter works wonders, just arrived spring and the movil screen stop working.","318":"Umm i used this phone for like 6 month now these are the poor side of this phone so far....CONS1) low internal storage2)low capacity processor ( crashes when u play games like \"Temple Run \"3)crashes every time when u play games4)No ics update will ever comes to this phone !!!!","319":"There are so many things disappointing about this phone.1. Anything in red shows in purple2. Picture quality is terrible3. Takes a very long time to chargeResolution is horrible!","320":"Did not send sms messages.Otherwise it is a very speedy phone that is very capable.If you just need it for voice calling its fine. Im hoping we just got a lemon.","321":"Made my day .I ordered 2 white samsung for my cousins in nepal but i can't figure out if its unlock or not i hope its unlock so they can use it. Good looking and the camera is \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb. They will love it \ud83d\udc95","322":"So far so good. Everything seems to be working as advertised.","323":":D","324":"This mobile is exceptionally good with all it's features and performance.Camera quality is excellent with 13 MP and 5 MP. I just don't carry my digital camera after getting this mobile as the pictures are clear.Audio is good.Dual sim option is another feature which attracted me towards this mobile. I was using 2 mobiles and need to get rid of one s it is difficult to maintain 2 mobiles. And this one, as advertised, is working well with 2 SIM cards \/ networks.It's been few months now I started using this mobile and didn't find any issues with it till date.Happy that I own a fantastic mobile for a decent price.Definitely recommended.","325":"Good condition. I have no issues so far.","326":"loving it","327":"I purchased my Note 4 back in May of this year. MyI typical data use is only about 2 GB a month. As the months have gone by the phone has a heat issue. Even with the GPS off it will heat up fairly quickly. The next issue is battery life. I just put my third battery in it.. all purchased on Amazon. I charged my new battery and with wifi on so no 4G or phone(on airplane mode) the battery is at 79% after just 3 hours...not good...My previous phone was a Note 2. It was bought used and lasted 2 years..I'm looking for a new phone after 3 months...","328":"Just what I wanted it to do,great I would recomend it for anyone who wants the best cell phone period!","329":"todo llego completo tal cual se describia en la publicacion","330":"The phone keeps cutting off, the battery runs low very fast, I think its a faulty battery and when I tried to down load stuff, error keeps popping up half way through the process, this phone cannot be used and I am very disappointed, a waste of my money. I would not recommend that anyone should purchase this phone.","331":"I purchased this phone as a gift for my grown son so I have not played with it. AllI know is he said it is great.","332":"Worked perfectly!!!","333":"My S3 gave out so I was confident this phone would be great.","334":"Phone was shipped fast and working great","335":"it''s not the best camera and cell phone for the egonomic, but is realy good instrument for me, take a clear photo, video and audio.the bad point is when you make a zoom, the noise into the motor zoom can captur for the mic, but this problem come in the best camcorder and is easy resolvo whit a bluetooth mic.","336":"Excellent, love it!","337":"Was spot on and a good reliable phone","338":"There are currently four non-embedded SIM formats. This phone uses the Micro-SIM (3FF) introduced in 2003 which measures 15mm long x 12mm wide x 0.76mm thick. For those who may have encountered the same oversight, there are articles available on how to trim down a larger format. If you are brave enough to seek out the guidance it is possible you have the manual dexterity and proper tools to safely accomplish the task.","339":"Had problems at first but with the warranty on it with Samsung it was fixed in no time.","340":"not an original product. its a knock off. I got another phone just like this one at verizon store and realized the difference right away. It feels different this phone bends and cracks much more, and has minor visual differences. the biggest give away is that i noticed that there was a gap at the top of the phone and i could easily slide mi finger nail inside and lift up the screen....","341":"Came with att symbol and not inlocked as indicated 8n description","342":"The device from this vendor arrived in an original box but not with all the separations that should come with it inside the box, it arrived floating inside it. The camera is not well balanced, all photos taken are blurred. The rest works ok.","343":"Great phone, fast both in performance and in networking. Streams TV via it's cellular connection (T-Mobile) at 15 Mbs, which is plenty for watching Hockey live in HD. Performance is 5 starts all around!So, why not 5 stars? For me this is a little large. Others will probably laugh when they read this but, I used to have a Galaxy S2, and I felt like the size of that was just right. I feel like the decision that the cellular makers have made that the newer the device the bigger the screen is the wrong choice. My S2 fit comfortably in my shirt pocket, the S5 sticks out the top.","344":"Works good","345":"It's simply one of the most amazing smartphones I've ever had. You can do almost anything you may think of with this phone. IPhones are really cool, but the S6 Edge is way better.","346":"Its so usefull and beautiful","347":"Nice","348":"Unfortunately, i hit the issue last night and tried everything in my knowledge to fix that all in vain. I called Samsung Tech support which was incredibly affable could not find my IMEI number in their system. I asked them why would that be, they said it could be a NON-US Warranty version that I bought. Tough the product is marketed with US warranty but Samsung is not able to find it in their system. Can someone help me pls....","349":"Best phone available today. Stunning 4K display, amazing camera and water proof....whaaaaatttttttt. Awesome.","350":"Hi thereI ordered this samsung galaxy s7 on jun 17 nd everything was very very great until 2 week ago i just realized that in the screen there is one pixel wrong. Is almost imperseptible but if you focus on this pixel you can see how s*** it looks like","351":"Love the phone. Battery life is terrible .","352":"I bought it for my daughter. Cosmetically, it was in better shape than I expected. Texting works fine. But to actually talk on the phone, it has to be slid open and it has to be on speakerphone. For a 13 year old girl who mostly texts, I suppose it's fine. I think I'll look elsewhere for her next phone, though.","353":"I lost my first one broke the second one and I love this one. The battery does not last real long otherwise it has evertything i want","354":"Prompt delivery as promised so far so good","355":"I previously owned this same phone when just after the warranty ended, the touch screen stopped working. I ordered this new one and it was brand new and just what I was hoping for. The battery life on this phone can't be beaten (although I don't use the internet on it) and it does everything I need it to! It also arrived quicker than I had expected!","356":"It is what we ordered. It is a nice little old flip phone. It surely fits our needs just fine.","357":"I wish I could give this positive marks but it was pretty disappointing right out of the box. It is extremely heavy. I don't think I've ever owned a cell phone that weighed this much. It is not comfortable to hold and feels like a brick. This is not the best Android version OS for this phone either. Generally when you have a phone that does not have a physical back button or a home button, the operating system has some sort of controls on the screen so you can navigate your phone. It took me a while to figure out how to exit the camera app because you had to swipe up to find a back button to exit the app. The e-reader side is pretty useless and poorly designed. Not only is the screen nonresponsive to touch (though it is meant to be) but the rear display is glossy rather than matte. This means that you'll get an incredible glare off the screen in the sun. What a bummer. As a Yotaphone 2 owner I have to say this doesn't come anywhere close to the design and quality of the Yotaphone. Unlike the Yotaphone, the e-ink display on this is app based, so whatever app they have is what you'll get out of the e-ink display. The apps are pretty weak to say the least. The e-reader app was the worst, with the e-reader store taking you straight to some Chinese site. With the Yotaphone I was able to mirror anything that was on the front screen and operate the phone using the rear screen as well as use any app on my phone. Overall the Siam 7X is an overpriced, prehistoric phone with a cheap e-reader on the back.","358":"They are ok but block out sometimes","359":"eXCELLENT PHONE","360":"I wrote 1 star because it says unlocked. I have the luxury of having 2 carriers, AT&T and Sprint. When I put my Sprint Sim in, NOTHING!!!!!!! I thought there was a problem with the phone, but right before I called customer service, I decided to try my AT&T sim. Worked perfect!! So, before you decide to buy this phone, make sure that you have either T Mobile or AT&T, that is the only 2 networks that it works on.","361":"First, I may be a difficult customer when it comes to a smart phone. I tried the Z, it's battery life was poor, so I tried this. It was really good in most ways, but it seems to not pull the cellular signal as well as my trusty Motorola Defy or my Google Nexus 4. Apparently Tmobile's signal is lacking in my area (Annapolis, MD) so I really noticed the difference. My friends were wowed by the underwater video demonstration I gave them. The other issue I had with the phone was bluetooth issues with multiple devices, such as my Toyota Prius, Bose Soundlink, and Jabra headset. I was hoping they would release the new version of Android before my return window closed in case that would resolve those issues. Supposedly people in areas where the 4.2 operating system were released for it, or people who have rooted their phone and put on 4.3 have experienced an improvement in signal strengthl. If the issues were resolved, Sony would have earned my money. The phone is FAST and the picture is great. Can hardly tell the difference between this picture and the Z. Phone feels great in the hand. Battery life is excellent. I would like to see more products like this and would like Sony to get my money with this, but it needs a little refinement. Please keep up the development of these type phones.","362":"Works well but is the size of a tablet","363":"GArbage. Phone is cheap, small and not worth a dime!","364":"The cell phone is great. However, there has been a problem transferring my contact list over to the new phone. Verizon is working the programming for this malfunction.","365":"Love it. Easy to see screen","366":"the phone stopped working after 1 week.","367":"I love this phone! It has many features that my last phone that cost even more did not have.Now what's not to love about this phone.It's indeed VERY KOOL!","368":"good cheap phone and seemed to work great until I had to reset the phone so I could let my son use it. I backed it up and did a factory reset. Now the phone is not worth a dam cause it says there is a privacy code setup. I never setup a privacy code and getting a hold of verykool is not easy. I did find a number to the San Diego office and was told a tech would call me back shortly... that was 2 days ago... Spend a little more and get a moto or any thing else... I would have gave this 5 stars if I could have only got tech support when needed.","369":"The biggest downside to this phone is from China. It looks great. I've been using it about a week and already having charging\/battery issues. Its definitely going back!","370":"Great product for the price. Easy set up. Just needed a sim card adapter to keep the micro sim in place.
